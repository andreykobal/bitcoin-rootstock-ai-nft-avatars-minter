## Prerequisites

1. Node.js & npm
2. MetaMask browser extension

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/ai-nft-avatar-minting.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ai-nft-avatar-minting
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the `REACT_APP_NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN` variable with your token from [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/):

```bash
REACT_APP_NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN=YOUR_NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN
```

5. Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action!

## Code Highlights:

1. **Switching To Bitcoin Testnet Network:**

   Users have the flexibility to switch between Ethereum networks, making the platform versatile.
   ```javascript
   async function switchToNetwork() {
       // Network configurations...
       await window.ethereum.request({
           method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',
           params: [{ chainId: currentNetwork.chainId }],
       });
   }
   ```

2. **Minting NFTs:**

   Seamless integration for minting NFTs, including error handling.
   ```javascript
   const mintToken = async () => {
       if (window.ethereum) {
           // Uploading, metadata generation and minting...
       } else {
           alert('Ethereum not detected! Please install and setup MetaMask.');
       }
   };
   ```

3. **AI-Generated Traits:**

   Fetch random metadata generated by AI for the avatar's traits.
   ```javascript
   const fetchRandomData = async () => {
       const response = await fetch("<API_URL>");
       const content = JSON.parse(data.content);
       setName(content.name);
       setDescription(content.description);
       // ... setting other attributes
   };
   ```

4. **IPFS Integration:**

   We utilize the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage.
   ```javascript
   const uploadFileToIPFS = async (fileOrUrl) => {
       // ... file upload logic
       const cid = await client.storeBlob(blob);
       return `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${cid}`;
   };
   ```


## Usage

1. **Selfie to Avatar**: Upload your selfie and watch as it gets transformed into an animated avatar.
2. **Traits Customization**: Personalize your avatar's traits using the sidebar. Choose custom values or click the "Randomize" button for AI-generated traits.
3. **Mint to Blockchain**: Once satisfied, mint your avatar as an NFT to the Bitcoin testnet using Rootstock. Ensure your MetaMask is set to the correct network.
4. **Interact & Play**: Once minted, you can engage with your avatar or use it as a skin in supported games.
